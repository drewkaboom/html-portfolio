<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! 
    
<p>I'm Drew, a shamanic sound healer, coder, audio professional, travel agent 
    and hip-hop musician from New York, USA. I am a reiki grand master traditionally 
    trained in shamanic sound therapy and have completed teacher trainings in 
    yoga, sound & shamanic coaching. </p>
    
<p>I offer freelance IT solutions as well as production assistance on and/or off set. 
    Sound healing, reiki & meditation is the specialty I contribute to Artemis Audio & Ayurveda, a retreat brand 
    founded by myself and partner, Sara. Fun fact about me is I started learning how to 
    code to learn to make apps for binural frequency listeners.</p>
    
<p>I'm excited to be able to understand the world like never before and eager to take my knowledge 
    to even higher levels. 
    </p>
 <p>Thank you for your time and I hope to be working with you soon!
